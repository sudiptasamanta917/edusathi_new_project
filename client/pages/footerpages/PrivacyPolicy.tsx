Transaction records and tax-related information are retained for 7 years as required by Indian accounting and tax regulations. Data may be retained longer when required for ongoing legal proceedings, regulatory investigations, or statutory obligations. All user data is stored within India to comply with data localization requirements.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Integrations</h3>

        <p>
          We integrate with secure payment processors, social media platforms for optional login features, and analytics tools to improve platform performance and marketing effectiveness.
